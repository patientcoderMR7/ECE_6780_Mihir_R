Lab 02: Interrupts

Part1: Enabling multiple peripheral interrupts and checking process flow
Configure and toggle all LED pins, Modify Systick Timer and toggle blue led with small delay, and enable EXTI peripheral interrupt to work together in system. 
Configure button pin as inout with EXTI peripheral, and toggle orange and green LEDs with button press

Part2: Explore Interrupt Nesting & Interrupt Priorities
Starve interupt by adding a long delay in peripheral interrupt (EXTI)
As a solution, set the appropriate priorities for all interrupts, so thay all work together without breaking flow (in case of a long running interrupt)
